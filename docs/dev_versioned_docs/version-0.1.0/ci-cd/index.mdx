# CI/CD Workflows

This section describes the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflows used in the Redis Message Queue Backend project.

## 🚀 **Quick Navigation**

Our CI/CD system is organized into focused, developer-friendly sections:

### **📋 [Continuous Integration](./continuous-integration)**

[![CI](https://github.com/Chisanan232/abe-redis/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Chisanan232/abe-redis/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)

- **CI workflow triggers and structure**  
- **Multi-Python version testing**
- **Code quality checks and coverage reporting**
- **Unit and integration test automation**

### **🔄 [Release System](./release-system)**

[![Release Validation](https://github.com/Chisanan232/abe-redis/actions/workflows/release-validate.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Chisanan232/abe-redis/actions/workflows/release-validate.yml)
[![Release](https://github.com/Chisanan232/abe-redis/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Chisanan232/abe-redis/actions/workflows/release.yml)

## 🎯 **CI/CD Overview**

We use **GitHub Actions** to automate testing, code quality checks, and deployment processes. Our CI/CD pipelines help maintain code quality, ensure tests pass, and streamline the release process.

**Monitor all workflows at:** [GitHub Actions Dashboard](https://github.com/Chisanan232/abe-redis/actions)

### **System Highlights**

✅ **Comprehensive CI**: Multi-Python testing, code quality, coverage reporting  
✅ **Intelligent Releases**: Intent-based configuration with supply chain security  
✅ **Advanced Documentation**: workflow_run pattern with DOCS_UPDATED flag logic  
✅ **Reusable Architecture**: DRY workflows with standardized operations  
✅ **Developer-Friendly**: Extensive validation, staging, and troubleshooting guidance
