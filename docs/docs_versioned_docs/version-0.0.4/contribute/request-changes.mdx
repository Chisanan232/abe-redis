# Requesting Additions or Changes

Have an idea for improving abe-redis? We welcome feature requests and suggestions from our community! This guide will help you submit effective feature requests.

## Before Submitting

Before submitting a feature request, please:

1. **Check existing requests**: Search the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Chisanan232/abe-redis/issues) to see if someone has already suggested a similar feature.
2. **Read the documentation**: Make sure the feature doesn't already exist or isn't already planned in our roadmap.
3. **Consider compatibility**: Think about how your suggestion fits with the existing architecture and goals of the project.

## How to Submit a Feature Request

Please submit feature requests through our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Chisanan232/abe-redis/issues) page using the "Feature Request" template.

### What to Include

An effective feature request should include:

1. **Clear and descriptive title**: Summarize the proposed feature concisely.
2. **Problem statement**: Describe the problem that this feature would solve.
   - What are you trying to accomplish?
   - Why is it difficult or impossible with the current implementation?
   - Who else might benefit from this feature?

3. **Proposed solution**: Describe your idea for implementing the feature.
   - Be as specific as possible
   - Include mockups or diagrams if applicable
   - Consider edge cases and potential issues

4. **Alternative solutions**: Have you considered other ways to solve this problem?

5. **Implementation considerations**: If you have technical insights about how to implement the feature, please share them.

6. **Impact and importance**: Explain why this feature would be valuable to users and the project.

## Example Feature Request

```
Title: Support configurable stream prefixes for project-specific routing

Problem Statement:
Currently, abe-redis automatically discovers streams matching the `slack:*` pattern. 
Teams adopting the backend for other integrations need the ability to configure 
custom prefixes (for example, `jira:*` or `webhooks:*`) without forking the package.

Proposed Solution:
Add a configuration option `REDIS_STREAM_PREFIXES` that accepts a comma-separated list 
of patterns. During consumption, use these patterns instead of the hard-coded `slack:*` value.

The implementation should include:
1. Extend `RedisMessageQueueBackend.from_env()` to parse the new environment variable.
2. Update `_get_streams_by_pattern` to iterate over the configured prefixes.
3. Document the new option in the quick-start and configuration guides.

Alternative Solutions:
1. Allow passing stream patterns directly to `consume()` for per-call overrides.
2. Provide a plugin hook where applications can register their own stream discovery logic.

Implementation Considerations:
- Ensure backward compatibility by defaulting to `slack:*` when the variable is unset.
- Validate input to avoid accidental wildcards that could match all Redis keys.

Impact and Importance:
This feature would make abe-redis usable in a wider range of projects while avoiding 
custom forks and hard-coded naming conventions.
```

## After Submitting

After you've submitted a feature request:

- Be responsive to questions about your proposal
- Be open to feedback and suggestions
- Consider contributing to the implementation if you have the skills

Thank you for helping improve abe-redis!
