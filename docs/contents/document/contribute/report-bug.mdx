## Example Bug Report

```
Title: Consumer loop stops after publishing batched events

Environment:
- OS: Ubuntu 24.04
- Python: 3.12.3
- abe-redis: 0.0.3
- Installed via pip

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Redis locally: `docker run -d --name test-redis -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine`
2. Set environment variables: `export QUEUE_BACKEND=redis && export REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0`
3. Run the example consumer:
   ```python
   asyncio.run(RedisMessageQueueBackend.from_env().consume().__anext__())
   ```
4. Publish three messages in quick succession using `backend.publish(...)`

Expected Behavior:
The consumer should continue iterating over all pending messages.

Actual Behavior:
The consumer receives the first message and then exits without errors.

Additional Information:
- Verified that stream retains pending entries via `redis-cli XPENDING slack:events`
- Logs collected with `QUEUE_BACKEND_DEBUG=true`
```
